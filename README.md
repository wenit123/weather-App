# ReactJS Fundamentals Curriculum
========

my very first ReactJS basic course to build a functioning Weather app using the [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api).

## How to install
```
npm install
```

## How to run
```
npm start
```
and then open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`

## PS
This is my very first experiment in learning with React following the lovely free basic course from
[@tylermcginnis33](http://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33).  
stuff used:

- react  
- react-router  
- axios  
- re-base for connecting to Firebase  
- babel to transpile JSX and some ES6 to JS  
- webpack  
- style,css loader  
- react-addons-css-transition-group  
- bootstrap
